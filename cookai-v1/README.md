## 👋 Hello, Fellow Food Lover!

Ever stared into your fridge, full of ingredients but empty of ideas? We've all been there. That's why we created **Cook**.

Cook isn't just another recipe app. It's a creative partner in the kitchen. It's designed to reduce food waste, spark your culinary creativity, and make cooking a joyful, stress-free experience. Whether you're a seasoned chef or just starting, Cook adapts to you, helping you make the most of what you have.

Our philosophy is simple: **Good food shouldn't be complicated, and no ingredient should go to waste.**

## ✨ Features That Sizzle

Cook is packed with intelligent features designed to feel like you have a professional chef by your side:
