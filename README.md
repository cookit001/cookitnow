## 🚀 Vision  

Cook AI V2 transforms the way people cook, eat, and live — turning kitchens into smart, connected spaces.  
It’s not just a recipe generator — it’s a Kitchen Operating System (KitchenOS) powered by AI, voice, and IoT integration.  

Cook will see, hear, and think with you — helping you plan meals, manage ingredients, discover new cuisines, and even talk to your smart fridge.
